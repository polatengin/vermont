- ✅ **Step execution engine** - Real shell command execution
- ✅ **Environment variables** - Job and step level support
- ✅ **Error handling** - Proper failure detection and workflow termination
- ✅ **Multi-line scripts** - Complex bash script support
- ✅ **Container execution support** - Docker-based step execution

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/polatengin/vermont.git
cd vermont

# Build the application
go build -o bin/vermont ./cmd/runner
```

### Usage

#### Running a Workflow

```bash
# Run a workflow file (executes real commands)
./bin/vermont run examples/simple-test.yml

# Run with development mode (no compilation needed)
make dev-run FILE=examples/simple-test.yml

# Output example:
# Executing workflow: Simple Test
# Job: hello
#   Steps: 4
#     Step 1: Hello World
#       Output: Hello, World!
#     Step 2: Show environment
#       Output: Runner OS: Linux
#     ...
```

#### Validating a Workflow

```bash
# Validate a workflow
./bin/vermont validate examples/simple-test.yml

# Validate with verbose output
./bin/vermont validate examples/ci-pipeline.yml -v
```

## Configuration

Vermont uses JSON configuration files. Generate a default configuration:

```bash
# Create default config (config will be created on first run)
./bin/vermont run examples/simple-test.yml
```

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "runner": {
    "workDir": "/tmp/vermont-runner",
    "maxConcurrentJobs": 2,
    "timeout": 3600,
    "labels": ["self-hosted", "vermont"]
  },
  "container": {
    "runtime": "docker",
    "dockerHost": "unix:///var/run/docker.sock",
    "networkMode": "bridge",
    "defaultImage": "ubuntu:22.04"
  },
  "storage": {
    "dataDir": "~/.vermont",
    "cacheDir": "~/.vermont/cache",
    "logsDir": "~/.vermont/logs"
  },
  "logging": {
    "level": "info",
    "format": "console",
    "file": ""
  }
}
```

## Supported Workflow Features

### Basic Syntax
- ✅ Workflow triggers (`on`)
- ✅ Jobs with `runs-on`
- ✅ Steps with `run` and `uses`
- ✅ Environment variables
- ✅ Job dependencies (`needs`)
- ✅ Conditional execution (`if`)

### Advanced Features
- ✅ Matrix builds (`strategy.matrix`)
- 🔄 Composite actions
- 🔄 Reusable workflows
- 🔄 Service containers
- 🔄 Artifacts
- 🔄 Secrets management

## Architecture

Vermont is a single binary application with two main commands:

1. **`vermont run`** - Executes workflows
2. **`vermont validate`** - Validates workflow syntax

### Core Packages

- `pkg/workflow` - YAML parsing and validation
- `pkg/executor` - Job and step execution
- `pkg/container` - Container management

## Step Execution Engine

### ✅ **Implementation Status**

The Vermont step execution engine is now fully functional with the following capabilities:

#### 🚀 **Core Features**

1. **Real Command Execution**
   - Executes shell commands using `bash -c`
   - Supports multi-line scripts
   - Proper command chaining and error handling

2. **Environment Variable Support**
   - Job-level environment variables (`jobs.<job>.env`)
   - Step-level environment variables (`steps[].env`)
   - Default GitHub Actions variables (GITHUB_ACTOR, RUNNER_OS, etc.)
   - Environment inheritance from system

3. **Error Handling**
   - Stops execution on command failure
   - Detailed error reporting with command and output
   - Proper exit codes and error propagation

4. **Output Management**
   - Captures and displays command output
   - Clean step-by-step execution display
   - Structured logging with execution times

5. **Container Execution Support**
   - Docker-based step execution
   - Automatic image pulling and management
   - Shell detection (bash for Ubuntu, sh for Alpine)
   - Host vs container execution based on configuration

#### 🧪 **Testing Completed**

- ✅ Basic command execution (`examples/simple-test.yml`)
- ✅ Environment variable handling (`examples/env-test.yml`)
- ✅ Error handling and failure scenarios (`examples/error-test.yml`)
- ✅ Multi-command scripts with proper chaining
- ✅ File creation and manipulation commands
- ✅ Integration with existing validation and configuration
- ✅ **Container execution** (`examples/container-test.yml`)
- ✅ **Alpine Linux support** (`examples/alpine-test.yml`)
- ✅ **Container error handling** (`examples/container-error-test.yml`)
- ✅ **Host vs container mode switching** via configuration

#### 📊 **Performance**

- Step execution times: 1-5ms for simple commands
- Environment setup: Negligible overhead
- Error detection: Immediate on command failure
- Memory usage: Minimal for command execution

#### 📝 **Example Usage**

```bash
# Execute workflow with real command execution (host mode)
make dev-exec ARGS="run examples/simple-test.yml -c host-config.json"

# Execute workflow in containers
make dev-exec ARGS="run examples/container-test.yml -c container-config.json"

# Test different container images
make dev-exec ARGS="run examples/alpine-test.yml -c container-config.json"

# Test error handling
make dev-run FILE=examples/error-test.yml

# Test environment variables
make dev-run FILE=examples/env-test.yml
```
